# Jitsi Meet Outlook Add-In
## Introduction
This is a small plug-in that aims to integrate Jitsi Meet with Microsoft Outlook. Specifically, it adds two main features:
1. A button in the Outlook calendar tab that opens a new appointment and inserts a randomly generated Jitsi Meet URL.
2. A set of controls in the Outlook appointment window that, for example, allows for specification of a Room ID of choice and whether participants will be muted upon entry to the room.

A screenshot of these features can be seen below:

It was created to fulfil [this](https://community.jitsi.org/t/plug-ins-for-adding-jitsi-meet-links-to-appointment-requests-emails/21564) request, and more generally with a view to facilitate organisational use of Jitsi Meet. This project is not affiliated with that of Jitsi Meet nor its creators.

## Installation
Go to the Installer folder and download the latest version. Unzip the file contents and then follow the instructions in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alDwd8ghO7A) video to mark the installer file as "trusted", before executing "setup.exe".

## Roadmap
The published code and installer is still at an early stage. Preliminarily, the following amendments are in the pipeline:
* Make the installation procedure less painful
* Add small icons to the buttons in the appointment ribbon
* Shift the controls in the appointment ribbon to the left

Since this plug-in is brand new, any feedback would be most appreciated!
